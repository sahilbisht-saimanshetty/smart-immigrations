            <p>12.1 Governing Law.</p>
            <p>
              All matters relating to this Agreement, and all matters arising
              out of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in
              contract, tort, or statute are governed by, and construed in
              accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
              effect to any conflict of law principles. 
            </p>
            <p>12.2 Dispute Resolution.</p>
            <p>
              Please read this Section carefully. It contains procedures for
              MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. Any
              dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this
              Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation
              or validity thereof, shall be submitted to and decided by a single
              arbitrator by binding arbitration under the rules of the American
              Arbitration Association in the State of Delaware. The decision of
              the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may
              be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction by
              either party. The prevailing party in the arbitration proceedings
              shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness costs
              and expenses, and all other costs and expenses incurred directly
              or indirectly in connection with the proceedings, unless the
              arbitrator shall for good cause determine otherwise. All
              arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. You agree that
              you may bring claims against the Company in arbitration only in
              your individual capacity and in so doing you hereby waive the
              right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in a
              class-action lawsuit or class action arbitration (either as a
              named-plaintiff or class member), and to assert or participate in
              any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated
              arbitration of any kind. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
              under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, the
              arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and
              may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or
              class proceeding. If a court decides that applicable law precludes
              enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a
              particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim)
              must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
              YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU
              ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
              CLASS ACTION.
            </p>

            <p> 12.3 Limitation to Time to File Claims.</p>
            <p>
              ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR
              RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED
              WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUED OR WHEN YOU
              REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THE CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER;
              OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY WAIVED AND
              BARRED.

            <p>13.1 Waiver.</p>
            <p>
              Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure of the
              Company to exercise, or delay by the Company in exercising, any
              right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement
              shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
              single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or
              privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
              or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
            </p>
            <p>13.2 Severability.</p>
            <p>
              The parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid,
              illegal, or unenforceable provision with a valid provision that
              most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the
              invalid provision.If any term or provision of this Agreement is
              found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal,
              or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability
              shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or
              invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
              other jurisdiction.
